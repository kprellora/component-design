            <p class= "description"> Making your writing sound formal </p>
            <p class="about"> It is usually the case that in formal writing you avoid the use of personal pronouns.
              These include I, me, we, us and you. However there are instances in certain disciplines where your lecturer will invite you to use the first person.
              In reflective journal writing for example, using the first person is appropriate.

            <p class="about"> When writing an essay, it is important to construct a reasoned argument that is supported by carefully researched evidence.
              The language that you use needs to be precise and uncluttered by unnecessary devices which have the potential to distract the reader, shift the meaning or detract from the clarity of...

            <p class="about"> Punctuation marks help you to organise your words into clauses and sentences, and hence into identifiable units of meaning.
              They are the signs that alert readers to the appropriate pauses in your text.
              These pauses signal where you intend the emphasis and intonation to be placed, and thus how you want the text to...

            <p class="about"> Any writing you do at university will require reference to recognised experts or authorities in that particular subject area (discipline), to give the thoughts, ideas and information in your assignment credibility.
              There are three ways of including the ideas of an expert in your text: quoting, paraphrasing, summarising.

              This list is made up of all the publications you have referred to within your assignment, and these are listed in alphabetical order according to the author’s surname (or title if there is no author).
